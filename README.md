# dcgan-svhn
Cycle GAN Winter-Summer transformation. The code is based on the miniproject of the chapter on GAN of the Udacity Deep Learning course. 

## Content
The notebook implements the following steps
* Load in the data
* Pre-process the data reducing the size of the images to 128x128x3
* Define the Generator and Discriminator architectures
* Define loss function and optimizer
* Train the networks, save after training and generate new images
## Features
If available, PyTorch trains on GPU.
